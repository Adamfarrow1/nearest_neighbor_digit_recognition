# Nearest Neighbor Digit Recognition

This project implements a simple image classification system using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to recognize handwritten digits. It serves as an introduction to machine learning and computer vision by working with image-based data and distance-based classification.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

- Loading and visualizing the digit dataset
- Flattening image data for distance-based comparison
- Implementing the Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm
- Evaluating classification accuracy
- Visualizing predictions and misclassifications

## Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn (if used for dataset loading)

## Features

- Basic implementation of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm from scratch
- Ability to classify handwritten digits
- Clear explanation of how Euclidean distance is used in classification
- Visual comparison of predicted vs. true labels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the following packages if not already available:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn


### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nearest-neighbor-digit-recognition.git


2. Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook nearest_neighbor_digit_recognition.ipynb


3. Run all the cells to load the data, train the model, and evaluate predictions.

## Customization

You can modify the notebook to:

- Test with different values of `k` in the k-NN algorithm
- Use a different image dataset
- Add normalization or PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Compare performance with other algorithms like logistic regression or SVM
